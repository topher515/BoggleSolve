I like to write a boggle solver in every new language I learn.

Doing so provides a brief overview of some important stuff

 - Classes and class instantiation
 - Class methods (and/or) static methods
 - Recursion
 - Importing libraries
 - Filesystem IO (for reading the dictionary)

### TODO:

 - Write README's for each language to get people running
