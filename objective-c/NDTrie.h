	@class NDTrie
	@abstract An immutable trie implemented in Objective-C
	@discussion The purpose of <tt>NDTrie</tt> is store strings in way to quickly retrieving all strings with a common prefix, it could also be used as a set equivelent though whether you would get any performance improvement over <tt>NSSet</tt> would need to be tested, it is possible since NDTrie only needs to deal with <tt>NSString</tt>s. <tt>NDTrie</tt> an immutable class with it's contents being set as creation, for a mutable version use the subclass <tt>NDMutableTrie</tt>. NDTrie does not store any of the actual strings added to it, you can think of it as copyng each string, the strings are actually broken down into individual cahracters so that string with common prefixes can be associated together. The trie can be though of as a set, with only one unique version of each string is stored in the trie attempts to add a string already contained within the trie have no effect.
