# Rhino Javascript

**(Updated 2021/08)** This is _extremely_ old code—written before `node` was a thing. It no longer runs but is left for historical purposes—to help demonstrate how ugly JavaScript was back in 2010.

## Original Readme:

This javascript was written to run in the rhino interpreter `rhino boggle.js`.
